An Eclipse project written in Java. I set out to write a solver for the Sokoban game (also known as PushBox).  The game was invented in Japan by //TODO add link and the first step was to create a simple graphical interface to display the solution. However I ended up writing an implementation of the Sokoban game, and at time of writing I'm about to add the original 50 mazes authored by Thinking Rabbit. Hopefully the solver will come later.
