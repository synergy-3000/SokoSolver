I set out to write a solver for the Sokoban game (also known as PushBox) and the first step was to create a simple graphical interface to display the solution. However I ended up writing an implementation of the Sokoban game, and at time of writing I'm about to add the original 50 mazes authored by Thinking Rabbit. Hopefully the solver will come later.
